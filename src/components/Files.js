        Eventually, I'll have a menu here that shows little widgetsâ€”calculator,
        scratchpad stored in local storage, etc. I'd also like to have options
        to view categories, tags, posts, videos, etc in a list. Perhaps I can
        let you save articles you wanna see later, setup custom filters, etc.
        here as well.
